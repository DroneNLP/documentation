# About the Project

## Motivation & Background

The widespread adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, across various sectors—from logistics and agriculture to infrastructure inspection and public safety—has underscored the critical need for robust operational monitoring and incident analysis. Drone flight logs, which record vast amounts of telemetry data and system messages, are indispensable for understanding flight behavior, diagnosing anomalies, and investigating incidents.

However, extracting actionable insights from these logs presents significant challenges: they are often voluminous, contain unstructured or semi-structured text, feature technical jargon, and may suffer from inconsistencies or noise. Manually sifting through these messages is a time-consuming, error-prone, and highly specialized task.

Our research addresses this bottleneck by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate and enhance the analysis of drone flight logs. We aim to bridge the gap between raw flight data and actionable intelligence, making drone operations safer and post-flight analysis more efficient.

## Research Goals

The primary objectives of the "NLP for Drone Flight Log Analysis" project are:

1.  **Develop a Comprehensive Methodology:** To establish and document a rigorous methodology for the collection, cleansing, and annotation of drone flight log messages, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
2.  **Create a Publicly Available Annotated Dataset:** To construct and release a high-quality, domain-specific annotated dataset of drone flight log messages, serving as a vital resource and benchmark for the NLP and aviation communities.
3.  **Propose & Evaluate NLP Frameworks:** To design and assess NLP-driven frameworks for critical analytical tasks, including:
    * **Event Recognition:** Identifying key flight events (e.g., takeoff, landing, RTH initiation).
    * **Problem Identification:** Pinpointing specific issues or anomalies (e.g., sensor errors, battery warnings).
    * **Log Abstraction:** Summarizing complex flight sequences or incidents.
    * **NER-based Term Extraction:** Identifying entities like Components, Functions, Parameters, Issues, Actions, and States.
    * **NER-based Semantic Role Labeling:** Extracting relationships between Events, their Implications/Effects, and Mitigation/Instructions.
