# Our Methodology: A Transparent Approach

The success and reliability of any data-driven research, especially in critical domains like aviation safety, hinge upon a meticulously documented and rigorously applied methodology. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the processes involved in creating the "NLP for Drone Flight Log Analysis" dataset and the associated analytical frameworks.

Our commitment to open science and reproducibility means that every step, from initial data collection and cleansing to detailed annotation procedures, is thoroughly explained and justified by relevant industry standards and academic best practices.
