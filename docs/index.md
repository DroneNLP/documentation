# NLP for Drone Flight Log Analysis

## Unlocking Actionable Insights from Flight Telemetry

Welcome to the central hub for the "NLP for Drone Flight Log Analysis" research project. This initiative leverages the power of Natural Language Processing to transform complex drone flight log messages into structured, actionable intelligence. Our goal is to enhance safety protocols, streamline maintenance, and bolster forensic analysis capabilities for the rapidly expanding world of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
