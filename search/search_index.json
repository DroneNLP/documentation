To obtain human-readable messages, each file was individually decrypted using the DJI Phantom Help Log Viewer online tool.<ul> <li>Tool Used: https://www.phantomhelp.com/logviewer/upload/</li> <li>Procedure: Each encrypted <code>.txt</code> log file was uploaded to the Phantom Help Log Viewer, decrypted, and then the resulting human-readable data was downloaded as a <code>.csv</code> file. This was a manual, file-by-file process.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Message and Timestamp Extraction: From the decrypted <code>.csv</code> flight logs, specific columns containing textual messages and their corresponding timestamps were extracted.<ul> <li>Extracted Columns: <code>APP.message</code>, <code>APP.tip</code>, and <code>APP.warning</code>.</li> <li>Forensic Timeline Construction: For each log, a simplified forensic timeline was constructed by pairing the extracted messages with their precise timestamps (date and time). This timeline forms the basis for subsequent cleansing and annotation.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>Data Sensitivity</p> <p>While the VTO Labs raw images are publicly available, the decryption and extraction process yields more detailed information. Our focus is on the messages themselves, and any sensitive contextual data not directly part of the message content is omitted from the final dataset.</p>"},{"location":"methodology/data-collection/#3-combined-raw-message-collection","title":"3.
